# Capstone Project - Purchase Request System (PRS)
The PRS is the capstone project for both the .NET and Java bootcamps.

The system supports users requesting products from vendors. Once approved by reviewers, the prequested products can be ordered from the vendors by creating a purchase order for that vendor that contains all the product approved for purchase.

Users must log into the system to have more than READONLY access to any data.
